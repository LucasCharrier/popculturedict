## About API-Dictonnaire

This is a side project, the aim was to keep in touch with my php skills
and to re-implement an old project.
It is a reimplementation of an old student project in php that I did in 2011.
It is usefull to take a look back at what I learn since this time.

## Front end

It is to use with a front end part in Vuejs

## Test and Implementation

I try to be as rigourous as possible. But you should keep in consideration:
- as it is a side project I might not be as rigourous as I will be on a "real" project,
regarding test especially.
Though I'll try to be on 80% coverage. 

## TODOS
